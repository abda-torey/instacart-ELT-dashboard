# Instacart E-Commerce Data Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project builds a real-time e-commerce data analytics pipeline using Instacart data to enable efficient decision-making and business insights. The pipeline handles large CSV files, ingests and processes them, and visualizes the processed data through dashboards. The process integrates tools like Apache Flink for handling large data ingestion, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as a data lake, Airflow for orchestration, dbt for data transformation, and Looker Studio for real-time analysis and visualization.

The end goal is to create a scalable system that efficiently handles large datasets while providing real-time insights into consumer behavior, product performance, and order management.

## Problem Statement

**Challenge:**  
Handling large volumes of raw e-commerce data from Instacart is challenging due to the need for real-time processing, cleaning, and transformation before the data can provide meaningful insights. Traditional approaches often lead to delayed analysis and limited visibility into key business metrics.

**Proposed Solution:**
- **Data Ingestion:** Apache Flink processes large CSV files in batch mode to efficiently handle the data volumes.
- **Data Lake Storage:** GCS is used to store raw and transformed data, holding product and order data for further processing.
- **Orchestration with Airflow:** Apache Airflow automates the movement of data from GCS to BigQuery, ensuring smooth and scalable workflows.
- **Data Transformation with dbt:** dbt cleans and enhances the raw data, creating dimensions, fact tables, and views to make it analytics-ready.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Looker Studio connects to the transformed tables in BigQuery, providing interactive dashboards for real-time analysis of key metrics such as product trends, user behavior, and order patterns.

This system enables stakeholders to gain actionable insights, improving decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Terraform:** Creates GCS buckets and BigQuery datasets.
- **Flink:** Processes large CSV files from Instacart and sinks them to the GCP bucket.
- **Airflow:** Moves files from the GCS bucket to BigQuery.
- **dbt Cloud:** Cleans the raw data to produce analytics-ready fact and dimension tables.
- **Looker Studio:** Provides real-time data visualization dashboards.
- **Makefile:** Runs project-specific commands.
- **Docker:** Containerizes the different services for portability.
- **Airflow:** Orchestrates the jobs in the pipeline.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Terraform
- Google Cloud account with necessary credentials

### Steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd instacart-elt-project
   ```

2. **Build and run Docker containers**:
   Use the Docker Compose file to spin up all necessary services (Airflow, Flink, etc.).
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**:
   Set up GCS buckets and BigQuery datasets by running the Terraform scripts.
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure Airflow and run DAGs**:
   Access the Airflow UI to trigger the DAGs for data ingestion and transformation.

## Usage

- **DAGs** are tagged with groups:
  - DAGs that trigger Flink jobs to process CSV files.
  - DAGs that move files from GCS to BigQuery.
  
- **dbt Commands**: dbt commands (like `dbt run` or `dbt build`) are executed in dbt Cloud. Due to the limitations of the free dbt developer account, dbt isn't connected directly to Airflow.

## Data Ingestion and Processing

1. **Flink for Data Ingestion**:  
   Large CSV files from Kaggle are processed in batch mode by PyFlink, which sinks the data directly to a GCS bucket.

2. **Airflow for Orchestration**:  
   Airflow moves files from the GCS bucket to BigQuery, creating tables in the dataset.

3. **dbt for Transformation**:  
   dbt is used to clean the data and create fact and dimension tables for further analysis and reporting.

## Visualization

- **Looker Studio**:  
  The dashboard displays various analyses such as top products, department-wise product filtering, and order trends.
  - Time series analysis shows how orders differ based on the day of the week.
